# MB14_Classical_mechanics

a small Labjournal for the module "MB14 Physik f√ºr Biologen"

This Repo contains this following experiments:
  * Pendulum
  * Elasticity and Torsion
  * Thomson Model
  * Prism spectrometer

The Instructor of this course recommended to use QtilPlot for the data analysis. But I think Python will do the job. This Repo is basically just for me and protocolling ever process on Git.
