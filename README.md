# MB14_Classical_mechanics

a small Labjournal for the module "MB14 Physik f√ºr Biologen"

This Repo contains this following experiments:
  * Pendulum
  * String Vibrations
  * Wheatstone Bridge
  * Principle of a Lens System

The Instructor of this course recommended to use QtilPlot for the data analysis. But I think Python will do the job too. This Repo is basically just for me and my Teammate to share our work. But if you find this Repo and it helps you, feel free to use it.
