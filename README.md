# MB14_Classical_mechanics

a small Labjournal for the module "MB14 Physik für Biologen"

This Repo contains this following experiments:
  * Pendulum
  * String Vibrations
  * Wheatstone Bridge
  * Principle of a Lens System

The Instructor of this course recommended to use QtilPlot for the data analysis. But I think Python will do the job. This Repo is basically just for me and protocolling ever process on Git.
